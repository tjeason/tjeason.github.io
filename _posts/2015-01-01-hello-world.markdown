  Since this is my first post, I just wanted to say hello, world! I wanted to reference my
  first blog post to new programmers who write their first "Hello, World", program. New developers
  learn how to write code using a popular programming language, such as Python, Ruby, C++, or Java,
  to write a simple text output of the famous message.
</p>

{% highlight python linenos %}
#!/usr/bin/env python

# File: hello_world.py

print "Hello, world!"

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  In my posts, I plan to share my interests, research, and developer experience.  Like manny open-source
  developers in the community, I want to share ideas, contribute, and provide positive experiences to
  others. I will my technical challenges and soultions at a higher leven than a traditional whitepaper.
  If required, code samples, graphs, and diagrams will be used to clarify a solution or experience.
</p>

<p>
  I look forward to contributing my experience on my developer blogger. Feel free to comment posts and
  fork any gists in my GitHub.  Happy writing and coding in the new year!
