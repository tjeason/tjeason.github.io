<p>
  I am a software engineer with experience in web application, automation, cloud,
  and infrastructure development. I have worked some of the largest-complex projects
  for large enterprise technology companies to innovative start-ups building a platform
  in a public cloud.
</p>

<p>
  My interests and experience include cloud computing, containers
  (<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>), application frameworks, full-stack
  web development, automating back-end services, and providng more software-defined,
  modular platforms. I have experence with the programming languages: C/C++, C#, Go,
  Java, JavaScript, JSON, Python, Shell Script, SQL, XML, YAML. Some of the technologies
  I have used are Amazon Web Services, Apache, Bootstrap, Django, Docker, Git, Linux,
  Nginx, Node.js, OpenStack, Play!, SQL/Non-SQL databases, and Windows Servers.
</p>

<p>
  I also enjoy being able to share technical knowledge with others. I have been fortunate enough to speak at
  tech conferences and colleges across the United States on projects, whitepapers,
  or subjects on cloud computing and data center infrastructure solutions, or my personal
  experiences as a developer.
