<p>
  I am a software developer at heart with a passion for bulding great computing tools and services.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently a senior technologist for one of the largest and greatest technology companies
  in the world. My job is to provide software-defined solutions to improve datacenter and cloud services.
  My work involves native cloud app development, infrastructure and platform automation, and finding new
  innovative ways to run physical and virtual infrastructure more efficiently in the company's datacenters
  across the globe.
</p>

<p>
  My interests and experience include cloud computing (<a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>), containers
  (<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>), DevOps for bare-metal and virtuals, Agile development, any type of
   app development. I have worked on C++, .Net, Java, Python, Go, and Ruby projects for the past five years.
</p>

<p>
  I also enjoy being able to share technical knowledge with others. I have been fortunate enough to speak at
  tech conferences and colleges across the United States on projects, whitepapers, or subjects on cloud computing
  or my personal experiences as a developer. I hope I can continue receiving these opportunites for the rest of my
  career.
</p>

<p>
  In my personal time, I plan to be more invested in open-source projects on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. So watch out repos! Get ready to
  be forked and cloned! Also, I am a big video gamer. I have dabbled with game development using Unity and even building
  my own 3-D game engine. I built the egine as my thesis in graduate school. I think cloud gaming has a lot of potential
  in the near future. So I am looking foward to figure out new ways to use a cloud to run my games.
